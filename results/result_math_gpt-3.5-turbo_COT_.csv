2x-b &\text{ if } x <-2.

\right.\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).",Level 5,Algebra,"For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must ""meet"" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\boxed{0}$.","For the piecewise function to be continuous, the function values at $x=2$ and $x=-2$ should be equal. This gives us two equations to find $a$ and $b$.

First, for $x=2$:
Setting $x=2$ in the first two equations to get:
\[a(2)+3 = 2a+3 \quad \text{ and } \quad 2 - 5 = -3.\]

Therefore, $2a+3 = -3$ and $a=-3$. 

For $x=-2$:
Setting $x=-2$ in the second and third equations:
\[-2 - 5 = -7 \quad \text{ and } \quad 2(-2)-b = -4 - b.\]

Thus, $-4 - b = -7$ and $b=3$.

Therefore, $a+b = -3 + 3 = \boxed{0}$.",1.0,3.353461980819702,343,202,141
1,"A rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",Level 5,Algebra,"Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{98}$.","Let $m$ be the number of band members in each row and $r$ be the number of rows. We are given the following system of equations:

\begin{align*}
mr+2 &< 100 \\
(m+1)(r-2) & = mr + 2
\end{align*}

Expanding the second equation, we get $mr+r-2m-2=mr+2$. Simplifying it further, we have $r-2m-2=2$. Rearranging the terms, we get $r=2m+4$.

Substitute the expression for $r$ into the first inequality:

\[m(2m+4)+2<100\]

Simplify it to get $2m^2 + 4m + 2 < 100$. Rearrange the terms to get $2m^2 + 4m - 98 < 0$. This can be further simplified to $m^2 + 2m - 49 < 0$.

Finally, the largest integer $m$ for which this inequality holds is $m=6$. Thus, the largest number of members the band could have is $m \times r = 6 \times (2 \times 6 + 4) = 6 \times 16 = 96$.

Therefore, the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{96}$.",0.0,7.09887957572937,442,294,148
2,What is the degree of the polynomial $(4 +5x^3 +100 +2\pi x^4 + \sqrt{10}x^4 +9)$?,Level 3,Algebra,"This polynomial is not written in standard form.  However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.","The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. In this case, the polynomial is $4 + 5x^3 + 100 + 2\pi x^4 + \sqrt{10}x^4 + 9$. 

To find the degree, we need to determine the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial. 

The powers of $x$ in the polynomial are 3, 4, 4, and 0. The highest power is 4. 

Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is $\boxed{4}$.",1.0,1.862668752670288,195,122,73
3,Evaluate $\left\lceil3\left(6-\frac12\right)\right\rceil$.,Level 3,Algebra,"Firstly, $3\left(6-\frac12\right)=18-1-\frac12=17-\frac12$.  Because $0\le\frac12<1$, we have $\left\lceil17-\frac12\right\rceil=\boxed{17}$.","To solve this problem, we first simplify the expression inside the ceiling function:

$3\left(6-\frac12\right) = 3\left(\frac{12}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 3\cdot\frac{11}{2} = \frac{33}{2} = 16.5$.

Then, we take the ceiling of this number, which means finding the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $16.5$, which is $17$.

Therefore, $\left\lceil3\left(6-\frac12\right)\right\rceil = \boxed{17}$.",1.0,2.7568891048431396,195,137,58
4,"Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\$$660. How many days did he not work?",Level 3,Algebra,"Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \begin{align*}
x+y &= 20 \\
60x - 30y &= 660 \\
\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.","Let's say Sam worked $x$ days and didn't work $20-x$ days. 

So, the total amount he earned can be expressed as:
\[60x - 30(20-x) = 660.\]

Solving for $x$:
\[60x - 30(20-x) = 660\]
\[60x - 600 + 30x = 660\]
\[90x - 600 = 660\]
\[90x = 1260\]
\[x = 14.\]

Therefore, Sam worked for 14 days and didn't work for $20-14=\boxed{6}$ days.",1.0,2.76820707321167,237,135,102
