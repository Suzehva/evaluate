0,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","We can start by finding $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20.
$120\%$ of 30 is $1.2 \times 30 = 36$.
$130\%$ of 20 is $1.3 \times 20 = 26$.

The positive difference between them is $36 - 26 = \boxed{10}$.",1.0,5.508362054824829,488,71,166
1,Find $x$ such that $\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction.,Level 4,Algebra,"First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.","Firstly, notice that $\lceil x \rceil$ is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $x$. Therefore, we should have $\lceil x \rceil \geq x$. 

Now suppose $\lceil x \rceil = n$, where $n$ is an integer. Then we have $n + x = \frac{23}{7}$. Since $\lceil x \rceil$ is also the ceiling of $x$, we must have $n < x + 1$. 

Substituting $n + x = \frac{23}{7}$ into $n < x + 1$, we get $\frac{23}{7} - 1 < x + 1$, or $\frac{16}{7} < x$.

Now suppose $x < n + 1$. Then we would have $n - 1 < x + 1$ and $n + x = \frac{23}{7}$. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get $\frac{16}{7} > x$.

Therefore, the only possible value for $x$ is $\boxed{\frac{16}{7}}$.",0.0,10.687063217163086,1012,247,176
2,Evaluate $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$.,Level 5,Algebra,"We have $i^5 = i^4\cdot i = 1\cdot (i) = i$.  We also have $i^{-25} = 1/i^{25} = 1/(i^{24}\cdot i) = 1/[1\cdot (i)] = 1/i = \frac1{i}\cdot\frac{i}{i} = i/(-1) = -i$ and $i^{45} = (i^{44})\cdot i= 1\cdot i =i$, and . So, adding these three results gives $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i+-i+i = \boxed{i}$.","We know that $i$ is the imaginary unit such that $i^2 = -1$. Therefore, we can simplify the powers of $i$ as follows:

$i^5 = i^4 \cdot i = (i^2)^2 \cdot i = (-1)^2 \cdot i = 1 \cdot i = i$
$i^{-25} = \frac{1}{i^{25}} = \frac{1}{i^{24} \cdot i} = \frac{1}{(i^2)^{12} \cdot i} = \frac{1}{(-1)^{12} \cdot i} = \frac{1}{1 \cdot i} = -i$
$i^{45} = i^{44} \cdot i = (i^2)^{22} \cdot i = (-1)^{22} \cdot i = 1 \cdot i = i$

Therefore, the expression $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$ simplifies to $i + (-i) + i = \boxed{i}$.",1.0,16.392380237579346,737,225,157
