0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the vertical asymptotes of a rational function, we need to look for the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero since division by zero is undefined. The denominator of the given function is $x^2+x-6$.

First, we factor the denominator by finding two numbers that multiply to $-6$ and add up to $1$:
$$x^2+x-6=(x+3)(x-2)$$

Setting the denominator equal to zero:
$$(x+3)(x-2)=0$$

This gives us the solutions $x=-3$ and $x=2$.

Therefore, the function has vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$. In total, there are $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",1.0,8.097747564315796,648,462,186,"['To find the vertical asymptotes of a rational function, we need to look for the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero since division by zero is undefined.
