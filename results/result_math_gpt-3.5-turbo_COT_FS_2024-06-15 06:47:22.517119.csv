0,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","To find $120\%$ of 30, we compute $1.2 \times 30 = 36$. To find $130\%$ of 20, we calculate $1.3 \times 20 = 26$. The positive difference between them is $36 - 26 = \boxed{10}$.",1.0,1.3129889965057373,234,68,166
