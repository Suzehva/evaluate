1,"A rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",Level 5,Algebra,"Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{98}$.","Let $x$ be the number of band members in the original rectangular formation. From the given conditions, we have the following equations:

1. $x = mr + 2$
2. $(m+1)(r-2) = x$

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:

$$(m+1)(r-2) = mr + 2$$
$$mr - 2m + r - 2 = mr + 2$$
$$r - 2m = 4$$

Since $x < 100$, we know that $x = mr + 2 < 100$. Substituting $x = mr + 2$ into this inequality:

$$mr + 2 < 100$$
$$mr < 98$$

Now, we need to find the largest value of $x$ that satisfies both equations:

$$r - 2m = 4$$
$$mr < 98$$

The largest integer solution to $mr < 98$ where $r$ and $m$ are positive integers and satisfy $r - 2m = 4$ is $m = 10$ and $r = 24$. Thus, the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{242}$.",False,4.695970296859741,408

At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\$$660. How many days did he not work?",Level 3,Algebra,"Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not.

\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$.

Given that $E = 660$, we have $60(20-x) - 30x = 660$.

Expanding and solving for $x$, we have:

$1200 - 60x - 30x = 660$

6,"What are all values of $p$ such that for every $q>0$, we have   $$\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q}>2p^2q?$$ Express your answer in interval notation in decimal form.",Level 5,Algebra,"First we'll simplify that complicated expression. We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \begin{align*}
pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\
&= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\
&= q(p+3)(q+p).
\end{align*}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator.  We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \geq 0$ so that $p + q \neq 0.$

Also because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides. This gives  \begin{align*}
3(p+3)&>2p^2\Rightarrow\\
3p+9&>2p^2 \Rightarrow\\
0&>2p^2-3p-9.
\end{align*}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality. We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\boxed{[0,3)}$.","To simplify the inequality, we re-write it as: $$3q^2+3pq+pq^2+p^2q > 2p^2q(p+q) \\ \implies q(3q+3p+pq) > 2pq^2(p+q) \\ \implies q(3q+3p+pq-2p^2q) > 0 \\ \implies q(3q+3p-q)(p-2q) > 0$$

For this inequality to hold true for all $q>0$, the expression inside the parentheses must be greater than zero, which gives us the inequalities: 
$$\begin{aligned} &3q+3p-q>0 \\ &\Rightarrow 2q+3p>0 \\ &\Rightarrow q > -\frac{3p}{2} \\ &3q+3p-q > 0 \\ &\Rightarrow 2q+3p > 0 \\ &\Rightarrow q > -\frac{3p}{2} \end{aligned}$$

Since $q>0$, we have the condition that $q> -\frac{3p}{2}$, or equivalently $p < -\frac{2}{3}q$. Together with $p > 2q$, the interval in decimal form becomes $(-\infty, -1.5) \cup (2, \infty)$. Therefore,
