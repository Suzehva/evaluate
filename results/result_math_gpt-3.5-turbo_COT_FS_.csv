0,Find the center of the circle with equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$.,Level 4,Algebra,"Completing the square, we get $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3, -1)}$.","Completing the square for both $x$ and $y$, we rewrite the equation as  \begin{align*}
(x^2-6x)+ (y^2+2y) &= 9 \\
(x^2-6x+9) + (y^2+2y+1) &= 9 + 9 + 1 \\
(x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 &= 19
\end{align*} The equation of a circle centered at $(h, k)$ with radius $r$ is given by $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$. Comparing this general form to our equation $(x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 19$, we see that the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3,-1)}$.",1.0,3.085597038269043,1313,174,1139
1,"What are all values of $p$ such that for every $q>0$, we have   $$\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q}>2p^2q?$$ Express your answer in interval notation in decimal form.",Level 5,Algebra,"First we'll simplify that complicated expression. We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \begin{align*}
pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\
&= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\
&= q(p+3)(q+p).
\end{align*}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator.  We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \geq 0$ so that $p + q \neq 0.$

Also because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides. This gives  \begin{align*}
3(p+3)&>2p^2\Rightarrow\\
3p+9&>2p^2 \Rightarrow\\
0&>2p^2-3p-9.
\end{align*}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality. We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\boxed{[0,3)}$.","We start by rearranging the given inequality as follows: $$\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q}-2p^2q>0.$$ Factoring out a $q$ from the numerator gives $$\frac{3q(p+q+p^2+3)}{p+q}-2p^2q>0.$$ Since $q>0$, we can multiply through by $p+q$ to get $$3q(p+q+p^2+3)-2p^2q(p+q)>0,$$ which simplifies to $$(3p^2-2p)q^2+(3p-2)q>0.$$ For this inequality to hold true for all $q>0$, the coefficient of $q^2$ must be positive, and the discriminant of the quadratic in $q$ must be negative. Thus, we must have $3p^2-2p>0$ and $(3p-2)^2-4(3p^2-2p)<0$. 

The inequality $3p^2-2p>0$ factors as $p(3p-2)>0$, which means $p\in (0, \frac{2}{3})\cup (0,2)$. The inequality $(3p-2)^2-4(3p^2-2p)<0$ simplifies to $9p^2-12p+4-12p^2+8p<0$, or $-3p^2-4p+4<0$, which doesn't have real solutions for $p$. 

Therefore, the only valid solution for $p$ is $p \in (0, \frac{2}{3})\cup (0,2)$ which, in decimal form and in interval notation, gives $\boxed{(0, 0.\overline{6}) \cup (0, 2)}$.",0.0,6.206171989440918,1593,418,1175

Then the seventh (and last) number in the row is $21 - 5 \cdot 6 = -9$.

4,"Tim wants to invest some money in a bank which compounds quarterly with an annual interest rate of $7\%$. To the nearest dollar, how much money should he invest if he wants a total of $\$60,\!000$ at the end of $5$ years?",Level 5,Algebra,"Recall the formula $A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times the interest is compounded in a year. This formula represents the idea that the interest is compounded every $1/n$ years with the rate of $r/n$.

Substituting the given information, we have \[60,\!000=P\left(1+\frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}.\]Solving for $P$ gives  $P=42409.474...$, which rounded to the nearest dollar is $\boxed{\$42409}$.","Let $P$ be the principal amount that Tim invests. The formula for compound interest is given by \[A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt},\] where:
- $A$ is the amount of money accumulated after $t$ years, including interest.
- $P$ is the principal amount (the initial amount of money Tim invests).
- $r$ is the annual interest rate (as a decimal).
- $n$ is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- $t$ is the number of years the money is invested for.

In this case, $r = 0.07$ (since $7\% = 0.07$), $n = 4$ (quarterly compounding), $t = 5$ years, and Tim wants to have $\$60,\!000$ at the end of the $5$ years.

So, we have the equation \[60,\!000 = P\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}.\]

Solving this equation for $P$, we find \[P = \frac{60,\!000}{\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{20}} \approx \boxed{41,\!061}.\] 

Therefore, Tim should invest approximately $\$41,\!061$.",0.0,5.9508819580078125,1469,302,1167
