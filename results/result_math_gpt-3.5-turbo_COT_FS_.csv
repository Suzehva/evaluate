0,Find the center of the circle with equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$.,Level 4,Algebra,"Completing the square, we get $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3, -1)}$.","To find the center of the circle given by the equation, we complete the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms. 

Starting with $x^2 - 6x$, we add $(6/2)^2 = 3^2 = 9$ inside the parentheses to complete the square: \[x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x-3)^2.\]

Similarly, we complete the square for $y^2 + 2y$ by adding $(2/2)^2 = 1$ inside the parentheses: \[y^2 + 2y + 1 = (y+1)^2.\]

Substituting these into the equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$ gives: \[(x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 9.\]

From this form, we can see that the center of the circle is at the point $(h, k) = (3, -1)$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3, -1)}$.",1.0,4.006255149841309,1373,234,1139
1,"What are all values of $p$ such that for every $q>0$, we have   $$\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q}>2p^2q?$$ Express your answer in interval notation in decimal form.",Level 5,Algebra,"First we'll simplify that complicated expression. We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \begin{align*}
pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\
&= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\
&= q(p+3)(q+p).
\end{align*}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator.  We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \geq 0$ so that $p + q \neq 0.$

Also because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides. This gives  \begin{align*}
3(p+3)&>2p^2\Rightarrow\\
3p+9&>2p^2 \Rightarrow\\
0&>2p^2-3p-9.
\end{align*}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality. We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\boxed{[0,3)}$.","First, rewrite the given inequality as $$3q^2+\dfrac{3p}{p+q}q+\dfrac{p^2}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$ The left side can be factored as $\left(q+\dfrac{p}{p+q}\right)^2$. So, we want $\left(q+\dfrac{p}{p+q}\right)^2> 2p^2q$. 

Now, let $x=q+\dfrac{p}{p+q}$. Then, the inequality can be rewritten as $x^2>2p^2(x-p)$. This simplifies to $x^2-2p^2x+2p^3>0$. 

The discriminant of this quadratic is $4p^4-8p^3=-4p^3(2-p)$. If $p>0$, then the discriminant is always negative, so the quadratic is always positive.

Since $x$ is the sum of two positive numbers, $x$ is always positive. Therefore, it suffices to ensure that the discriminant is negative in order to ensure that the quadratic is positive for all $x$. This gives us the inequality $-4p^3(2-p)<0$. The solutions are $0<p<2$.

Therefore, all values of $p$ such that the inequality holds for all $q>0$ are $\boxed{(0,2)}$.",0.0,5.493217468261719,1482,307,1175

[/asy]",Level 2,Algebra,"Since $18 - 14 = 4$, the common difference in the first column of squares is 4, so the number above 14 is $14 - 4 = 10$, and the number above 10 is $10 - 4 = 6$.  This is also the fourth number in the row, so the common difference in the row is $(6 - 21)/3 = -5$.

Then the seventh (and last) number in the row is $21 - 5 \cdot 6 = -9$.  In the second column, the common difference is $[(-17) - (-9)]/4 = -2$, so $N = -9 - (-2) = \boxed{-7}$.","Let the common difference of the top sequence be $d_1$, the common difference of the middle sequence be $d_2$, and the common difference of the bottom sequence be $d_3$. Then we can express the numbers given in the diagram as follows:

Top row: $21, 21+d_1, 21+2d_1, N-17$

Middle column: $21, 21+d_2, 21+2d_2$

Bottom row: $14, 14+d_3, 14+2d_3, N$

Since the top row and middle column are arithmetic sequences, then $21+2d_1 = 21+d_2$, which implies $d_2 = d_1$.

Since the middle column and bottom row are also arithmetic sequences, then $21+d_2 = 14+d_3$, which implies $d_3 = d_2 - 7 = d_1 - 7$.

Now, we can express $N$ in terms of $d_1$ as follows: \[N = 14 + 3d_1\]

To find the value of $N$, we use the fact that the common difference of the bottom row is $18 - 14 = 4$: \[4 = d_3 = d_1 - 7\] Solving for $d_1$, we get $d_1 = 11$.

Substituting this back into the expression for $N$, we get: \[N = 14 + 3 \cdot 11 = \boxed{47}\]",0.0,5.122983932495117,1757,338,1419
4,"Tim wants to invest some money in a bank which compounds quarterly with an annual interest rate of $7\%$. To the nearest dollar, how much money should he invest if he wants a total of $\$60,\!000$ at the end of $5$ years?",Level 5,Algebra,"Recall the formula $A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times the interest is compounded in a year. This formula represents the idea that the interest is compounded every $1/n$ years with the rate of $r/n$.

Substituting the given information, we have \[60,\!000=P\left(1+\frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}.\]Solving for $P$ gives  $P=42409.474...$, which rounded to the nearest dollar is $\boxed{\$42409}$.","The compound interest formula is given by the formula $A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$, where:

- $A$ is the amount of money in the account after $t$ years,
- $P$ is the principal amount (initial investment),
- $r$ is the annual interest rate (decimal),
- $n$ is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and
- $t$ is the number of years.

In this case, we want to find the principal $P$ such that $A = 60000$, $r = 0.07$, $n = 4$ (quarterly compounding), and $t = 5$. Plugging these values into the formula, we have:

\[60000 = P\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}\]
\[60000 = P(1.0175)^{20}\]
\[60000 = P(1.40559583607)\]
\[P = \frac{60000}{1.40559583607} \approx 42659.52\]

Therefore, Tim should invest approximately $\boxed{42659}$ dollars (rounded to the nearest dollar) in the bank.",0.0,6.344320058822632,1437,270,1167
