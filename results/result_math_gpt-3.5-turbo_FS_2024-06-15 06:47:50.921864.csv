0,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","To find the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20, we can calculate $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20 separately and then find the difference between the two results.

$120\%$ of 30 is $1.2 \times 30 = 36$

$130\%$ of 20 is $1.3 \times 20 = 26$

The positive difference between these two values is $36 - 26 = 10$.

Therefore, the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20 is $\boxed{10}$.",1.0,2.4167730808258057,231,145,86
