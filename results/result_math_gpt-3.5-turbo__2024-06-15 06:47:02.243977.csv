0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the vertical asymptotes of the graph, we need to look for values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero since division by zero is undefined.

In this case, the denominator of the function is $x^2 + x - 6$. We can factor this quadratic:
$$x^2 + x - 6 = (x+3)(x-2)$$

Setting each factor to zero, we find that the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero are $x=-3$ and $x=2$. These are the values where the vertical asymptotes of the graph occur.

Therefore, the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.",1.0,2.723301410675049,222,167,55
