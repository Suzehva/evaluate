0,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","To find the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20, we first need to calculate each amount.

$120\%$ of 30 = 30 * 1.2 = 36

$130\%$ of 20 = 20 * 1.3 = 26

Now, we find the positive difference between these two amounts by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number:

36 - 26 = 10

Therefore, the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20 is $\boxed{10}$.",1.0,5.047157287597656,648,390,258,"['To find the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20, we first need to calculate each amount.\n\n$120\\%$ of 30 = 30 * 1.2 = 36\n\n$130\\%$ of 20 = 20 * 1.3 = 26\n\nNow, we find the positive difference between these two amounts by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number:\n\n36 - 26 = 10\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20 is $\\boxed{10}$.', ""Let's calculate each of the two expressions:\n\n1. $120\\%$ of 30: $1.2 \\times 30 = 36$\n2. $130\\%$ of 20: $1.3 \\times 20 = 26$\n\nNow, find the positive difference between the two results:\n\n$36 - 26 = 10$\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20 is $\\boxed{10}$."", 'To find the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20, we calculate each separately and then find the difference.\n\nThe first calculation is $120\\%$ of 30:\n$120\\% \\times 30 = 1.2 \\times 30 = 36$\n\nThe second calculation is $130\\%$ of 20:\n$130\\% \\times 20 = 1.3 \\times 20 = 26$\n\nNow, we find the positive difference between these two values:\n$36 - 26 = 10$\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20 is $\\boxed{10}$.']"
