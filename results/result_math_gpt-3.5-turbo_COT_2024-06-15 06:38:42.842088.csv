0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the vertical asymptotes of the given function, we need to find the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero. 

The denominator of the function is a quadratic $x^2+x-6$, which can be factored as $(x+3)(x-2)$. 

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us two possible values for $x$:
1. $x+3 = 0 \implies x = -3$
2. $x-2 = 0 \implies x = 2$

Therefore, the graph of the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has two vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.

The final answer is $\boxed{2}$.",1.0,2.735628366470337,224,162,62
