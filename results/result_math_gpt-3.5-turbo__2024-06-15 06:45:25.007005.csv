0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the vertical asymptotes of a rational function, we need to identify any values of \(x\) that make the denominator of the function equal to zero. Vertical asymptotes occur at these values because division by zero is undefined. 

In this case, the denominator of the function \(x^2+x-6\) can be factored as \((x+3)(x-2)=0\). Setting each factor to zero gives us \(x+3=0\) and \(x-2=0\), which leads to \(x=-3\) and \(x=2\).

Therefore, the graph of the function has \(\boxed{2}\) vertical asymptotes at \(x=-3\) and \(x=2\).",1.0,2.261549472808838,206,151,55
