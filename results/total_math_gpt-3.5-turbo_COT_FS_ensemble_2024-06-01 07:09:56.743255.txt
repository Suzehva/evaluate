Q: How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?
A: The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.
Q: What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?
A: One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.
Q: Find $x$ such that $\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction.
A: First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.
