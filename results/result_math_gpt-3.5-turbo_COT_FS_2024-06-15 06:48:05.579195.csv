0,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","We first find $120\%\text{ of }30$ and $130\%\text{ of }20$:

$120\%\text{ of }30 = 1.2\cdot 30 = 36$

$130\%\text{ of }20 = 1.3\cdot 20 = 26$

The positive difference between these two quantities is $36-26=\boxed{10}$.",1.0,1.5592403411865234,253,87,166
