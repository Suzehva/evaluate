0,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","Let $x = 30$ and $y = 20$. We want to find $120\%$ of $x$ minus $130\%$ of $y$:

$0.12x - 0.13y = 0.12(30) - 0.13(20) = 3.6 - 2.6 = 1$

The positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20 is $\boxed{1}$.",0.0,1.970017910003662,193,107,86
