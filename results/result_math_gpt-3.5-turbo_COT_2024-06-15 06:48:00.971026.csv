0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the vertical asymptotes of the function, we need to identify the values of $x$ for which the denominator of the function is equal to zero, since division by zero is undefined.

The denominator of the function is $x^2 + x - 6$. We can factor this polynomial as $(x+3)(x-2)=0$. Setting each factor to zero, we find that $x=-3$ and $x=2$.

Therefore, the function has vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$. Therefore, the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",1.0,1.9026281833648682,204,142,62
