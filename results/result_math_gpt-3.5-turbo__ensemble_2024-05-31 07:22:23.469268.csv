0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine where the denominator of the function is equal to zero, as division by zero is undefined. 

The denominator of the function is $x^2 + x - 6$. We can factor this to find its roots:
$$x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2)$$

Setting this equal to zero gives us:
$$x + 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = 0$$
$$x = -3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 2$$

Therefore, the function has vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$. So, the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",1.0,12.695584058761597,814,120,55
1,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","To find the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20, we can calculate each value individually first:

$120\%$ of 30 is $1.2 \times 30 = 36$

$130\%$ of 20 is $1.3 \times 20 = 26$

Then, we find the positive difference between them:

$36 - 26 = 10$

Therefore, the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20 is $\boxed{10}$.",1.0,9.304427862167358,678,103,54
2,Find $x$ such that $\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction.,Level 4,Algebra,"First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.","Let $n$ be an integer such that $n \leq x < n+1$. Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n$.

From the given equation, we have:

$n + x = \frac{23}{7}$

Subtracting $n$ from both sides, we get:

$x = \frac{23}{7} - n$

Since $n$ is an integer, let's find the largest integer $n$ such that $\frac{23}{7} - n < 1$. This gives $n=3$. 

Therefore, \[x = \frac{23}{7} - 3 = \boxed{\frac{2}{7}}.\]",0.0,15.324279546737671,1149,191,64
3,Evaluate $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$.,Level 5,Algebra,"We have $i^5 = i^4\cdot i = 1\cdot (i) = i$.  We also have $i^{-25} = 1/i^{25} = 1/(i^{24}\cdot i) = 1/[1\cdot (i)] = 1/i = \frac1{i}\cdot\frac{i}{i} = i/(-1) = -i$ and $i^{45} = (i^{44})\cdot i= 1\cdot i =i$, and . So, adding these three results gives $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i+-i+i = \boxed{i}$.","We need to simplify each term first:
1. $i^5 = i^4 \cdot i = (i^2)^2 \cdot i = (-1)^2 \cdot i = 1 \cdot i = i$
2. $i^{-25} = \frac{1}{i^{25}} = \frac{1}{(i^2)^{12} \cdot i} = \frac{1}{(-1)^{12} \cdot i} = \frac{1}{1 \cdot i} = \frac{1}{i} = -i$
3. $i^{45} = i^{4 \cdot 11 + 1} = (i^4)^{11} \cdot i = (1)^{11} \cdot i = 1 \cdot i = i$

Now we can find the sum: $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i + (-i) + i = \boxed{2i}$",0.0,14.244543075561523,886,162,45
4,"If $2^8=4^x$, what is the value of $x$?",Level 1,Algebra,"Rewrite $4$ as $2^2$ to find $4^x=2^{2x}$.  Since $2^8=2^{2x}$, we have $2x=8$ which implies $x=\boxed{4}$.","To solve this problem, we can rewrite $2^8$ and $4^x$ so that they have the same base:

$2^8 = (2^2)^4 = 4^4$

Now, we can set up the equation $4^4 = 4^x$:

$4^4 = 4^x$

Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:

$4 = x$

Therefore, $\boxed{x=4}$.",1.0,8.474965333938599,592,92,49
