0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the number of vertical asymptotes for the given function, we need to determine where the denominator is equal to zero, as vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero.

The denominator of the function is $x^2+x-6$. We can factor this expression to find where it is equal to zero:
$ x^2 + x - 6 = (x+3)(x-2) = 0 $

Setting each factor to zero gives us the solutions:
$ x+3=0 \Rightarrow x=-3 $
$ x-2=0 \Rightarrow x=2 $

Therefore, the function has vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$. So, it has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",1.0,5.5668768882751465,559,394,165,"['To find the number of vertical asymptotes for the given function, we need to determine where the denominator is equal to zero, as vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero.\n\nThe denominator of the function is $x^2+x-6$.
