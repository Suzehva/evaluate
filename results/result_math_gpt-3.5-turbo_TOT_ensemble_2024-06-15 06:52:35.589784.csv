0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","Expert 1: First, I will factor the denominator. $x^2+x-6 = (x+3)(x-2)$.

Expert 2: Next, I will find the vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator equal to 0. So, $x+3=0$ and $x-2=0$.

Expert 3: Finally, the vertical asymptotes occur at $x=-3$ and $x=2$. So, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",1.0,5.328401327133179,662,305,357,"['Expert 1: First, I will factor the denominator. $x^2+x-6 = (x+3)(x-2)$.\n\nExpert 2: Next, I will find the vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator equal to 0.
