0,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","To find the positive difference between $120\%$ of $30$ and $130\%$ of $20$, we first calculate each value separately. 

$120\%$ of $30$ is $1.2 \times 30 = 36$.

$130\%$ of $20$ is $1.3 \times 20 = 26$.

The positive difference between $36$ and $26$ is $36 - 26 = 10$. 

Therefore, the positive difference between $120\%$ of $30$ and $130\%$ of $20$ is $\boxed{10}$.",1.0,6.107733249664307,829,331,498,"['To find the positive difference between $120\\%$ of $30$ and $130\\%$ of $20$, we first calculate each value separately. \n\n$120\\%$ of $30$ is $1.2 \\times 30 = 36$.\n\n$130\\%$ of $20$ is $1.3 \\times 20 = 26$.\n\nThe positive difference between $36$ and $26$ is $36 - 26 = 10$. \n\nTherefore, the positive difference between $120\\%$ of $30$ and $130\\%$ of $20$ is $\\boxed{10}$.', 'To find $120\\%$ of 30, we calculate $1.2 \\times 30 = 36$.\n\nTo find $130\\%$ of 20, we calculate $1.3 \\times 20 = 26$.\n\nThe positive difference between these two values is $36 - 26 = 10$. \n\nTherefore, the positive difference between $120\\%$ of 30 and $130\\%$ of 20 is $\\boxed{10}$.', 'To find $120\\%$ of 30, multiply 30 by $1.20$:\n$$(1.20)(30) = 36$$\n\nTo find $130\\%$ of 20, multiply 20 by $1.30$:\n$$(1.30)(20) = 26$$\n\nThe positive difference between these values is:\n$$36 - 26 = 10$$\n\nTherefore, the positive difference is $\\boxed{10}$.']"
