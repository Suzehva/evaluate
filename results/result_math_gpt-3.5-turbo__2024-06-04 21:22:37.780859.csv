0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the vertical asymptotes of the graph, we need to determine where the denominator of the function becomes zero, as division by zero is undefined. 

The denominator of the function is $x^2 + x - 6$, which can be factored as $(x+3)(x-2)$. Thus, the function becomes undefined at $x=-3$ and $x=2$. These are the vertical asymptotes of the graph.

Therefore, the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.",1.0,2.242912530899048,186,131,55
