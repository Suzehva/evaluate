0,"Let \[f(x) = \left\{

x-5 &\text{ if } -2 \le x \le 2, \\
2x-b &\text{ if } x <-2.

\right.\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).",Level 5,Algebra,"For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must ""meet"" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\boxed{0}$.","To find $a$ and $b$ such that the function is continuous, we need to ensure that each piece of the function matches up at the points where their domains intersect.

1. For $x>2$ and $-2 \leq x \leq 2$ to be continuous at $x=2$, we have $a(2) + 3 = 2 - 5$, which simplifies to $2a + 3 = -3$.

2. For $-2 \leq x \leq 2$ and $x < -2$ to be continuous at $x=-2$, we have $(-2) - 5 = 2(-2) - b$, which simplifies to $-7 = -4 - b$.

Solving these equations, we find:

1. $2a + 3 = -3 \Rightarrow 2a = -6 \Rightarrow a = -3$

2. $-7 = -4 - b \Rightarrow b = -3$

Therefore, $a + b = -3 + (-3) = -6$. 

So, for the function to be continuous, $a + b = -6$.",0.0,4.074744939804077,364,249,115
1,"A rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",Level 5,Algebra,"Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{98}$.","Let's denote the number of band members as $mr + 2$, where $m$ is the number of members in each row and $r$ is the number of rows. 

According to the problem, if the number of members in each row is increased by 1 and the number of rows is reduced by 2, then each band member has a place in the new formation. This means that the new number of band members is equal to the number of places in the new rectangular formation. 

In the new formation, the number of places is $(m+1)(r-2)$. Therefore, we have the following equation:

$(m+1)(r-2) = mr + 2$

Expanding and simplifying this equation gives:

$mr + r - 2m - 2 = mr + 2$

$r - 2m - 2 = 2$

$r = 2m + 4$

We also know that the number of band members is less than 100:

$mr + 2 < 100$

Substitute $r = 2m + 4$ into the above inequality:

$m(2m + 4) + 2 < 100$

$2m^2 + 4m + 2 < 100$

$2m^2 + 4m - 98 < 0$

$m^2 + 2m - 49 < 0$

(m + 7)(m - 7) < 0

This inequality holds true for $-7 < m < 7$ since the number of members in a row cannot be negative.

So, the largest integer value that satisfies the given conditions is $\boxed{6}$.",0.0,6.423372983932495,474,352,122
2,What is the degree of the polynomial $(4 +5x^3 +100 +2\pi x^4 + \sqrt{10}x^4 +9)$?,Level 3,Algebra,"This polynomial is not written in standard form.  However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.","To find the degree of the polynomial, we simply need to determine the highest power of the variable present in the polynomial. In this case, the polynomial is in standard form with terms $5x^3$, $2\pi x^4$ and $\sqrt{10}x^4$, which have the highest power of $x$ as 4. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 4.",0.0,1.8126044273376465,131,84,47
3,Evaluate $\left\lceil3\left(6-\frac12\right)\right\rceil$.,Level 3,Algebra,"Firstly, $3\left(6-\frac12\right)=18-1-\frac12=17-\frac12$.  Because $0\le\frac12<1$, we have $\left\lceil17-\frac12\right\rceil=\boxed{17}$.","First, we need to simplify the expression inside the ceiling function:

$3\left(6-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 3\left(\frac{12}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 3\left(\frac{11}{2}\right) = \frac{33}{2} = 16.5$

The ceiling function of a number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to that number. So, the ceiling of 16.5 is 17.

Therefore, $\left\lceil3\left(6-\frac12\right)\right\rceil = \left\lceil16.5\right\rceil = 17$.",0.0,2.247084617614746,178,146,32
4,"Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\$$660. How many days did he not work?",Level 3,Algebra,"Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \begin{align*}
x+y &= 20 \\
60x - 30y &= 660 \\
\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.","Let's let x be the number of days Sam did not work. 

If Sam worked for 20 days, he would earn 20 * 60 = $\$$1200. 
For each day that he did not work, $\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. 
Therefore, his total earnings can be calculated as: 
Earnings = ($\$$60 * days worked) - ($\$$30 * days not worked) 
660 = (60 * (20-x)) - (30 * x) 
660 = 1200 - 60x - 30x 
660 = 1200 - 90x 
540 = -90x 
x = -6 

Since we can't have negative days, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, Sam did not work for 6 days in the 20-day period.",0.0,2.4015347957611084,249,173,76
