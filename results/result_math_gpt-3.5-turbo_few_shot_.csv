0,"Let \[f(x) = \left\{

x-5 &\text{ if } -2 \le x \le 2, \\
2x-b &\text{ if } x <-2.

\right.\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).",Level 5,Algebra,"For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must ""meet"" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\boxed{0}$.","For the function $f(x)$ to be continuous at the points where the branches meet, the values of $f(x)$ from each side need to be equal at those points. 

We first evaluate $f(x)$ at $x = 2$ and $x = -2$:
For $x>2, f(x) = ax+3 \implies f(2) = 2a+3$.
For $-2 \le x \le 2, f(x) = x - 5 \implies f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3$.
Setting these two expressions equal, $2a + 3 = -3 \implies a = -3$.

Also, for $-2 \le x \le 2, f(x) = x - 5 \implies f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7$.
For $x <-2, f(x) = 2x-b \implies f(-2) = 2(-2) - b = -4 - b$.
Setting these two expressions equal, $-4 - b = -7 \implies b = -4+7 = 3$.

Therefore, $a + b = (-3) + 3 = \boxed{0}$.",1.0,4.451023578643799,1078
1,"A rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",Level 5,Algebra,"Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{98}$.","Let $x$ be the number of band members. We know that $x = mr + 2$ for some positive integers $m$ and $r$, and $r(m+1) = 2(m-2)$. Considering the second equation and expanding, we get $mr + r = 2m - 4$. Since $x < 100$, then $mr < 98$. We can list the possible values of $mr$, along with corresponding values of $r$, $m$, and $x$:

$mr = 6$, gives $r = 6, m = 1$, and $x = 8$
$mr = 8$, gives $r = 4, m = 2$, and $x = 10$
$mr = 12$, gives $r = 4, m = 3$, and $x = 14$
$mr = 20$, gives $r = 5, m = 4$, and $x = 22$
$mr = 30$, gives $r = 6, m = 5$, and $x = 32$
$mr = 42$, gives $r = 7, m = 6$, and $x = 44$
$mr = 56$, gives $r = 8, m = 7$, and $x = 58$
$mr = 72$, gives $r = 9, m = 8$, and $x = 74$
$mr = 90$, gives $r = 10, m = 9$, and $x = 92$

Observe that the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{92}$.",0.0,7.728614330291748,1165
2,What is the degree of the polynomial $(4 +5x^3 +100 +2\pi x^4 + \sqrt{10}x^4 +9)$?,Level 3,Algebra,"This polynomial is not written in standard form.  However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.","The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of $x$ that appears in the polynomial. In this case, the polynomial is $5x^3 + 2\pi x^4 + \sqrt{10}x^4$, so the highest power of $x$ is $4$. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is $\boxed{4}$.",1.0,1.5305607318878174,812
3,Evaluate $\left\lceil3\left(6-\frac12\right)\right\rceil$.,Level 3,Algebra,"Firstly, $3\left(6-\frac12\right)=18-1-\frac12=17-\frac12$.  Because $0\le\frac12<1$, we have $\left\lceil17-\frac12\right\rceil=\boxed{17}$.","We have $3\left(6-\frac{1}{2}\right)=3\cdot\frac{11}{2}=\frac{33}{2}=16.5$. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $16.5$ is $17$. Thus, $\left\lceil3\left(6-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right\rceil = \boxed{17}$.",1.0,1.8091685771942139,808
4,"Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\$$660. How many days did he not work?",Level 3,Algebra,"Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \begin{align*}
x+y &= 20 \\
60x - 30y &= 660 \\
\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.","Let $x$ be the number of days Sam did not work. This means that he worked for $20-x$ days.

Since he earns $\$60$ for each working day and $\$30$ is subtracted for each day he does not work, we can write the equation:

$60(20-x) - 30x = 660$.

Expanding and simplifying gives $1200 - 60x - 30x = 660$. Combining like terms yields $1200 - 90x = 660$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = \dfrac{540}{90} = 6$.

Therefore, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.",1.0,2.851055145263672,914
