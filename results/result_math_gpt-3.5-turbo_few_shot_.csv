1,"A rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",Level 5,Algebra,"Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{98}$.","Let $x$ be the number of band members. We are given that $x = mr + 2$, and also that there are fewer than 100 band members, so $x < 100$. 

We are told that when $m+1$ band members are placed in each row and the number of rows are reduced by 2, the arrangement works out perfectly, so we have $(m+1)(r-2) = x$. 

Substitute $x = mr + 2$ into $(m+1)(r-2) = x$ to get 
\[(m+1)(r-2) = mr + 2.\]
Expanding this yields $mr + r - 2m - 2 = mr + 2 \Rightarrow r - 2m = 4$. Therefore, we have that $r \equiv 2m \pmod{4}$, which means that $r$ is of the form $2m + 4k$ for some integer $k$. Since $x = mr + 2 < 100$, we must have $m < 50$. 

To maximize $x$, we see that setting $m = 49$ is the largest possible value for $m$. For this value of $m$, $r = 96$, so $x = mr + 2 = 49 \cdot 96 + 2 = \boxed{4706}$.",False,4.4517295360565186,1107

4,"Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\$$660. How many days did he not work?",Level 3,Algebra,"Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not.

x+y &= 20 \\
60x - 30y &= 660 \\
\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.","Let $x$ be the number of days Sam worked and $y$ be the number of days he did not work.

We know that Sam worked for $x$ days and did not work for $y$ days for a total of 20 days, so we have $x + y = 20$.

We also know that he earned $60x$ on days he worked and lost $30y$ on days he did not work. Since he received a total of $\$660$, we have $60x - 30y = 660$.

Solving these two equations simultaneously:
$\begin{cases} x + y = 20 \\ 60x - 30y = 660 \end{cases}$

From the first equation, we get $x = 20 - y$.

Substitute $x=20-y$ into the second equation:
$60(20-y) - 30y = 660$

$1200 - 60y - 30y = 660$

$-90y = -540$

$y = 6$

5,Find the center of the circle with equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$.,Level 4,Algebra,"Completing the square, we get $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3, -1)}$.","To find the center of the circle, we rewrite the equation in the form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is its radius.

x^2 - 6x & = (x^2 - 6x + 9) - 9, \\

We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \begin{align*}
pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\
&= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\
&= q(p+3)(q+p).
\end{align*}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator.  We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \geq 0$ so that $p + q \neq 0.$

Also because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides. This gives  \begin{align*}
3(p+3)&>2p^2\Rightarrow\\
3p+9&>2p^2 \Rightarrow\\
0&>2p^2-3p-9.
\end{align*}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality. We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\boxed{[0,3)}$.","We first simplify the inequality:
$$\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q}>2p^2q$$
$$\frac{3q(p^2+q+3p+3)}{p+q}>2p^2q$$
$$\frac{3q(p + 3)(q + 1)}{p + q} > 2p^2q$$
Cross multiplying and simplifying further results in:
$$3q(p + 3)(q + 1) > 2p^2q(p+q)$$
$$3q^2 + 3q^2p + 3q + 9q > 2p^2q + 2p^3q$$
$$6q^2 + 3q^2p + 3q + 9q > 2p^2q + 2p^3q$$
Using the fact that $q > 0$, we divide each side by $q$:
$$6q + 3pq + 3 + 9 > 2p^2 + 2p^3$$
$$6 + 3p + 3 + 9 > 2p^2 + 2p^3$$
$$18 + 3p > 2p^2 + 2p^3$$
$$18 > 2p^2 + 2p^3 - 3p$$
$$18 > 2p^2 + 2p^2 - 3p$$
So we must find the values of $p$ that satisfy $2p^2 + 2p^2 - 3p < 18$, or $4p^2 - 3p - 18 < 0$. This quadratic factors into $(2p+3)(2p-6)<0$ which has solutions $-\frac{3}{2}  < p < 3$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{(-1.5, 3)}$.",False,8.734723329544067,1203
