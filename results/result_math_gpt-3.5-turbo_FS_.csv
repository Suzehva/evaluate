0,Find the center of the circle with equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$.,Level 4,Algebra,"Completing the square, we get $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3, -1)}$.","To find the center of the circle represented by the equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of the equation of a circle, which is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.

Completing the square for $x$ and $y$ in the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9 \]
\[ x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 2y + 1 = 9 + 9 + 1 \]
\[ (x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19 \]

Comparing this with the standard form, we see that the center of the circle is at $(3, -1)$. Therefore, \(\boxed{(3, -1)}\) is the center of the circle.",1.0,4.591382026672363,653,222,431
1,"What are all values of $p$ such that for every $q>0$, we have   $$\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q}>2p^2q?$$ Express your answer in interval notation in decimal form.",Level 5,Algebra,"First we'll simplify that complicated expression. We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \begin{align*}
pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\
&= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\
&= q(p+3)(q+p).
\end{align*}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator.  We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \geq 0$ so that $p + q \neq 0.$

Also because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides. This gives  \begin{align*}
3(p+3)&>2p^2\Rightarrow\\
3p+9&>2p^2 \Rightarrow\\
0&>2p^2-3p-9.
\end{align*}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality. We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\boxed{[0,3)}$.","To solve this inequality, let's simplify the left-hand side of the inequality first:
\begin{align*}
\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q} &> 2p^2q \\
\frac{3pq(q+p) + 3q^2(q+p)}{p+q} &> 2p^2q \\
\frac{3q(q+p)(p+3)}{p+q} &> 2p^2q \\
\frac{3q(p+3)}{1} &> 2p^2q \\
3q(p+3) &> 2p^2q \\
3pq+9q &> 2p^2q \\
9q &> 2p^2q - 3pq \\
9q &> q(2p^2 - 3p) \\
9 &> 2p^2 - 3p \\
0 &> 2p^2 - 3p - 9 \\
0 &> 2p^2 - 6p + 3p - 9 \\
0 &> 2p(p-3) + 3(p-3) \\
0 &> (2p + 3)(p-3)
\end{align*}

To find the values of $p$, we solve for $p$ in the inequality $(2p + 3)(p-3) < 0$:
The critical points are $p=-\frac{3}{2}$ and $p=3$.

Testing the intervals $(-\infty, -\frac{3}{2})$, $(-\frac{3}{2}, 3)$, and $(3, \infty)$, we find that the inequality holds true in the interval $(-\frac{3}{2}, 3)$.

Therefore, all values of $p$ such that the given inequality holds for every $q>0$ are $p \in \boxed{(-1.5, 3)}$.",0.0,7.445109605789185,905,438,467

4,"Tim wants to invest some money in a bank which compounds quarterly with an annual interest rate of $7\%$. To the nearest dollar, how much money should he invest if he wants a total of $\$60,\!000$ at the end of $5$ years?",Level 5,Algebra,"Recall the formula $A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times the interest is compounded in a year. This formula represents the idea that the interest is compounded every $1/n$ years with the rate of $r/n$.

Substituting the given information, we have \[60,\!000=P\left(1+\frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}.\]Solving for $P$ gives  $P=42409.474...$, which rounded to the nearest dollar is $\boxed{\$42409}$.","To find how much money Tim should invest, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}\]

Where:
- $A$ is the amount of money at the end of the investment period (which is $\$60,\!000$ in this case)
- $P$ is the principal amount (the initial investment)
- $r$ is the annual interest rate (which is $7\%$ or $0.07$ as a decimal)
- $n$ is the number of times the interest is compounded per year (which is quarterly, so $n = 4$)
- $t$ is the number of years the money is invested for

Plugging in the given values, we get:

\[60000 = P\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \times 5}\]

\[60000 = P\left(1 + 0.0175\right)^{20}\]

\[60000 = P(1.0175)^{20}\]

\[60000 = P(1.40397321829)\]

\[P = \frac{60000}{1.40397321829}\]

\[P \approx 42743.47\]

Therefore, Tim should invest $\$42,\!743$ (to the nearest dollar) in the bank to have a total of $\$60,\!000$ after $5$ years.
