0,Find the center of the circle with equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$.,Level 4,Algebra,"Completing the square, we get $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3, -1)}$.","To find the center of the circle with the given equation, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of the equation of a circle, which is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius of the circle.

Completing the square for both $x$ and $y$, we have:
\begin{align*}
x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y &= 9 \\
(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 + 2y + 1) &= 9 + 9 + 1 \\
(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 &= 19
\end{align*}

Comparing this with the standard form, we see that the center of the circle is $(3, -1)$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3, -1)}$.",1.0,2.970808267593384,641,210,431
1,"What are all values of $p$ such that for every $q>0$, we have   $$\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q}>2p^2q?$$ Express your answer in interval notation in decimal form.",Level 5,Algebra,"First we'll simplify that complicated expression. We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \begin{align*}
pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\
&= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\
&= q(p+3)(q+p).
\end{align*}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator.  We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \geq 0$ so that $p + q \neq 0.$

Also because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides. This gives  \begin{align*}
3(p+3)&>2p^2\Rightarrow\\
3p+9&>2p^2 \Rightarrow\\
0&>2p^2-3p-9.
\end{align*}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality. We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\boxed{[0,3)}$.","To solve the inequality, we first simplify the left side of the inequality:

$$\frac{3(pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq)}{p+q} = \frac{3q(q+p)(p+3)}{p+q} = 3q(p+3).$$

Therefore, our inequality becomes:

$$3q(p+3) > 2p^2q.$$

Simplifying further by canceling $q$ from both sides (since $q>0$), we get:

$$3(p+3) > 2p^2.$$
$$3p+9 > 2p^2.$$
$$2p^2 - 3p - 9 < 0.$$

Now, we factorize the quadratic inequality:

$$2p^2 - 4p + p - 9 < 0.$$
$$2p(p-2) + 1(p-9) < 0.$$
$$(2p+1)(p-9) < 0.$$

The critical points of this inequality are $p=-\frac{1}{2}$ and $p=9$. From here, we can analyze the sign of the inequality in the intervals created by the critical points:

Test $p=-1$: $(-1)\cdot(-\frac{3}{2})<0 \implies \text{True}.$
Test $p=5$: $(11)\cdot(-1)<0 \implies \text{True}.$
Test $p=10$: $(21)\cdot1>0 \implies \text{False}.$

Therefore, the values of $p$ that satisfy the inequality are $p \in \boxed{(-\frac{1}{2},9)}$.",0.0,5.592592000961304,842,375,467
2,"If $x = 2$ and $y = 5$, then what is the value of $\frac{x^4+2y^2}{6}$ ?",Level 1,Algebra,We have  \[\frac{x^4 + 2y^2}{6} = \frac{2^4 + 2(5^2)}{6} = \frac{16+2(25)}{6} = \frac{16+50}{6} = \frac{66}{6} = \boxed{11}.\],"Substitute $x = 2$ and $y = 5$ into the expression $\frac{x^4+2y^2}{6}$:

[/asy]",Level 2,Algebra,"Since $18 - 14 = 4$, the common difference in the first column of squares is 4, so the number above 14 is $14 - 4 = 10$, and the number above 10 is $10 - 4 = 6$.  This is also the fourth number in the row, so the common difference in the row is $(6 - 21)/3 = -5$.

Then the seventh (and last) number in the row is $21 - 5 \cdot 6 = -9$.  In the second column, the common difference is $[(-17) - (-9)]/4 = -2$, so $N = -9 - (-2) = \boxed{-7}$.","Let the common differences of the arithmetic sequences be $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_3$ respectively.

The top row of squares has 6 integers, which means the last value of the arithmetic sequence is the starting number $N$ plus 5 times the common difference $d_1$. Therefore, the sum of the top row is $21 + 14d_1 + 18 - 17d_1 = 39 - 3d_1$.

The column on the left has 4 integers, so the sum of the first column is $21 - 17 - N - (N - d_2) - (N - 2d_2) - (N - 3d_2) = 4N - 6d_2 - 3$.

The column on the right has 4 integers, so the sum of the second column is $18 + N + (N + d_3) + (N + 2d_3) + (N + 3d_3) = 4N + 6d_3 + 18$.

Since all these sums are equal, we have:
\begin{align*}
39 - 3d_1 &= 4N - 6d_2 - 3 = 4N + 6d_3 + 18
\end{align*}

Therefore, $4N = 39 - 3d_1 + 6d_2 + 3 = 39 - 3(d_1 - 2d_2 - 1) = 39 - 3k$ where $k$ is a constant integer.

The possible values of $N$ that are less than $100$ are $37, 34, 31, 28, 25, 22, 19, 16, 13$, and $10$.

As the arithmetic sequences are distinct, we know that as $N$ decreases by $3$, the common difference for the top row $d_1$ will increase by $3$. This means, as $N$ ranges from $37$ down to $10$, the common difference $d_1$ will range from $2$ to $23$.

However, only for $N = \boxed{19}$ will the arithmetic sequences be distinct, making it the correct answer.",0.0,8.149689197540283,1206,495,711
4,"Tim wants to invest some money in a bank which compounds quarterly with an annual interest rate of $7\%$. To the nearest dollar, how much money should he invest if he wants a total of $\$60,\!000$ at the end of $5$ years?",Level 5,Algebra,"Recall the formula $A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times the interest is compounded in a year. This formula represents the idea that the interest is compounded every $1/n$ years with the rate of $r/n$.

Substituting the given information, we have \[60,\!000=P\left(1+\frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}.\]Solving for $P$ gives  $P=42409.474...$, which rounded to the nearest dollar is $\boxed{\$42409}$.","We can use the formula for compound interest: 

\[ A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after \( t \) years, including interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money) that was invested,
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and
- \( t \) is the time in years the money is invested.

In this case, \( A = \$60000 \), \( r = 0.07 \), \( n = 4 \) (quarterly), and \( t = 5 \).

We need to find \( P \). Plugging in the values, we have:

\[ 60000 = P\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4\cdot 5} \]

\[ 60000 = P\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{20} \]

\[ 60000 = P\left(1.0175\right)^{20} \]

\[ \frac{60000}{1.0175^{20}} = P \]
