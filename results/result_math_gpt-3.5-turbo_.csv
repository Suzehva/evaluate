For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\boxed{0}$.","For the function to be continuous at $x=2$ and $x=-2$, we need the function values to be equal at the points where the different pieces meet. 

So, at $x=2$, we have $2a+3=2-5$.

Solving for $a$:
\[2a+3=-3 \implies 2a=-6 \implies a=-3.\]

At $x=-2$, we have $-2-b=-2(-2)-b$.

Solving for $b$:
\[-2-b=-2(-2)-b \implies -2-b=4-b \implies -2=4 \text{ (this is not possible)}.\]

So, the function cannot be continuous at $x=-2$. Therefore, there is no real number $a+b$ satisfying the condition given.

1,"A rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",Level 5,Algebra,"Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{98}$.","Let $m$ be the number of band members in each row and $r$ be the number of rows. 

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. $mr + 2 < 100$ as the band has less than 100 members.
2. $(m+1)(r-2) = mr + 2$ as when the number of members in each row is increased by 1 and the number of rows is reduced by 2, there are exactly enough places for each band member.

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the largest number of members the band could have. 

Expanding the second equation gives:
$m(r-2) + r - 2 = mr + 2$
$m(r-2) + r - 2 = mr + 2$
$mr - 2m + r - 2 = mr + 2$
$-2m + r = 4$

Now, we substitute this into the first equation:
$mr + 2 < 100$
$(4+r)m + 2 < 100$
$4m + mr + 2 < 100$
$4m + 4 - 2 + 2 < 100$
$4m < 96$
$m < 24$

Thus, the largest possible number of members the band could have is $m=23$.

2,What is the degree of the polynomial $(4 +5x^3 +100 +2\pi x^4 + \sqrt{10}x^4 +9)$?,Level 3,Algebra,"This polynomial is not written in standard form.  However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.","The degree of a polynomial is given by the highest power of the variable in the polynomial.

3,Evaluate $\left\lceil3\left(6-\frac12\right)\right\rceil$.,Level 3,Algebra,"Firstly, $3\left(6-\frac12\right)=18-1-\frac12=17-\frac12$.  Because $0\le\frac12<1$, we have $\left\lceil17-\frac12\right\rceil=\boxed{17}$.","To evaluate this expression, we first simplify the expression inside the ceiling function:

$3\left(6-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 3\left(\frac{12}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 3\left(\frac{11}{2}\right) = \frac{33}{2}$

Next, we take the ceiling of $\frac{33}{2}$, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\frac{33}{2}$, which is $17$.

4,"Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\$$660. How many days did he not work?",Level 3,Algebra,"Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \begin{align*}
x+y &= 20 \\
60x - 30y &= 660 \\
\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.","Let's assume that Sam worked for $x$ days and did not work for $y$ days. 
We know that on days that he works, he earns $60$ dollars per day and for each day that he does not work, 30 dollars are subtracted from his earnings. Since Sam worked for 20 days, we have the equation: 
\[60x - 30y = 660\]
Additionally, we know that the total number of days is 20, so:
\[x + y = 20\]
Now, we can solve this system of equations. We will multiply the second equation by 30 and add it to the first equation:
\[60x - 30y + 30x + 30y = 660 + 600\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[90x = 1260\]
Solving for x, we get $x = 14$. 
Therefore, the number of days Sam did not work is:
\[y = 20 - x = 20 - 14 = 6\]
So, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.",1.0,4.839234828948975,329,234,95
