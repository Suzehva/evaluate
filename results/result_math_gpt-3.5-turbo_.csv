0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the vertical asymptotes of a rational function, we need to identify the values of $x$ for which the denominator is equal to $0$, since division by zero is undefined.

The denominator of the given function is $x^2 + x - 6$. We need to solve the equation $x^2 + x - 6 = 0$ to find the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to $0$.

Factoring the quadratic equation, we have:

$(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0$

Setting each factor to $0$, we get:

$x + 3 = 0 \implies x = -3$

$x - 2 = 0 \implies x = 2$

Therefore, the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.

So, the graph of the function has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",1.0,3.9655721187591553,263,208,55
1,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","To find the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20, we need to first calculate each expression:

$120\%$ of 30 is $1.20 \times 30 = 36$

$130\%$ of 20 is $1.30 \times 20 = 26$

Thus, the positive difference between the two is:

$36 - 26 = 10$

Therefore, the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20 is $\boxed{10}$.",1.0,2.640885829925537,177,123,54
2,Find $x$ such that $\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction.,Level 4,Algebra,"First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.","First, let's rewrite the given equation as $\lceil x \rceil + x = \frac{23}{7}$. 

Let $n$ be the integer part of $x$, i.e., $n \leq x < n+1$. Then, we have:

$\lceil x \rceil = n+1$ 

Substitute into the equation and solve for $x$:

$n + 1 + x = \frac{23}{7}$

$ x + \frac{7n}{7} + \frac{7}{7} = \frac{23}{7}$

$x = \frac{23 - 7n - 7}{7}$

Simplify:

$x = \frac{16 - 7n}{7}$

$x = \frac{16}{7} - \frac{7n}{7}$

$x = \frac{16}{7} - n$

So, $x$ can take different forms, but it satisfies the equation when it equals $\frac{16}{7} - n$. Since $x$ should be expressed as a common fraction, let's rewrite this as:

$x = \frac{16 - 7n}{7}$

Thus, $\boxed{x = \frac{16 - 7n}{7}}$.",0.0,5.574078559875488,334,270,64
3,Evaluate $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$.,Level 5,Algebra,"We have $i^5 = i^4\cdot i = 1\cdot (i) = i$.  We also have $i^{-25} = 1/i^{25} = 1/(i^{24}\cdot i) = 1/[1\cdot (i)] = 1/i = \frac1{i}\cdot\frac{i}{i} = i/(-1) = -i$ and $i^{45} = (i^{44})\cdot i= 1\cdot i =i$, and . So, adding these three results gives $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i+-i+i = \boxed{i}$.","We know that $i$ is defined as the imaginary unit such that $i^2 = -1$. 

Let's simplify each term:

1. $i^5$
Since $i^2 = -1$, we have $i^3 = i^2 \cdot i = -1 \cdot i = -i$, and $i^4 = i^3 \cdot i = -i \cdot i = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1$. Therefore, $i^5 = i^4 \cdot i = 1 \cdot i = i$.

2. $i^{-25}$
Using the property that $i^a = \frac{1}{i^{-a}}$, we can rewrite $i^{-25}$ as $\frac{1}{i^{25}}$. Since $i^4 = 1$, we know that $i^{25} = (i^4)^6 \cdot i = 1^6 \cdot i = i$. Therefore, $i^{-25} = \frac{1}{i^{25}} = \frac{1}{i} = -i$.

3. $i^{45}$
We can rewrite $i^{45}$ as $i^{44} \cdot i = (i^4)^{11} \cdot i = 1^{11} \cdot i = i$.

Now, let's add all the simplified terms: 
\[i + (-i) + i = i\]

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{i}$.",1.0,4.938884019851685,366,321,45
4,"If $2^8=4^x$, what is the value of $x$?",Level 1,Algebra,"Rewrite $4$ as $2^2$ to find $4^x=2^{2x}$.  Since $2^8=2^{2x}$, we have $2x=8$ which implies $x=\boxed{4}$.","We know that $4=2^2$. Therefore, we can rewrite $4^x$ as $(2^2)^x=2^{2x}$. So we have:

$2^{8}=2^{2x}$

Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:

$8=2x$

Solving for $x$:

$x= \boxed{4}$",1.0,1.400789499282837,136,87,49
