0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the vertical asymptotes of the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$, we need to determine where the denominator equals zero. The denominator is $x^2+x-6=(x+3)(x-2)$, so it equals zero when $x=-3$ or $x=2$.

Therefore, the graph has two vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.

\[\boxed{\text{The graph of } y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6} \text{ has 2 vertical asymptotes.}}\]",0.0,2.691096782684326,184,129,55
1,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","To find the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20, we first need to calculate each of these quantities.

$120\%$ of 30 is $1.20 \times 30 = 36$

$130\%$ of 20 is $1.30 \times 20 = 26$

Now, we find the positive difference between these two values:

$36 - 26 = 10$

Therefore, the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20 is $\boxed{10}$.",1.0,2.163123846054077,181,127,54
2,Find $x$ such that $\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction.,Level 4,Algebra,"First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.","Let $n$ be the integer part of $x$, so $n \leq x < n+1$. Then $\lceil x \rceil = n$.

Given equation: $n + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$.

Substitute $n = \lfloor x \rfloor$ into the equation:

$x + \lfloor x \rfloor = \dfrac{23}{7}$

$x + n = \dfrac{23}{7}$

Since $n$ is an integer, multiply both sides by $7$:

$7x + 7n = 23$

Substitute $n = x - \lfloor x \rfloor$:

$7x + 7(x - \lfloor x \rfloor) = 23$

$7(2x - \lfloor x \rfloor) = 23$

$2x - \lfloor x \rfloor = \dfrac{23}{7}$

Since $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is an integer, it must be $3$, as $2(3) = \dfrac{6}{7} < \dfrac{23}{7} < 2(4) = \dfrac{8}{7}$.

Thus, $x = \dfrac{3}{1} = \boxed{\dfrac{3}{1}}$.",0.0,4.589255094528198,352,288,64
