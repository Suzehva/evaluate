0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","To find the vertical asymptotes of the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$, we need to determine where the denominator $x^2+x-6$ equals zero, since division by zero is undefined.

The equation $x^2+x-6=0$ can be factored as $(x+3)(x-2)=0$, which gives us the solutions $x=-3$ and $x=2$. These are the values where the function will have vertical asymptotes.

Therefore, the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.",1.0,5.969151020050049,404,148,55
1,What is the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20?,Level 1,Algebra,"One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\frac{1}{100}=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\frac{1}{100}=26$.  The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.","To find the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20, we need to calculate both values first.

$120\%$ of 30 is calculated as:

\[
1.2 \times 30 = 36
\]

$130\%$ of 20 is calculated as: 

\[
1.3 \times 20 = 26
\]

Now, to find the positive difference between these two values, we subtract them:

\[
36 - 26 = 10
\]

So, the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20 is $\boxed{10}$.",1.0,5.480918645858765,390,137,54
2,Find $x$ such that $\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction.,Level 4,Algebra,"First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.","Let $n$ be the integer part of $x$ and $0 \leq r < 1$ be the decimal part of $x$, such that $x = n + r$. Then, we have:

\begin{align*}
\lceil x \rceil + x &= n + 1 + n + r = 2n + r \\
2n + r &= \frac{23}{7}
\end{align*}

Since $n$ is an integer, we must have $0 \leq r < 1$ and $\frac{23}{7} - 2n = r$. The only integer values for $n$ that satisfy this constraint are $n = 3, 4$. 

For $n = 3$, we have $r = \frac{23}{7} - 2(3) = \frac{23}{7} - \frac{42}{7} = \frac{-19}{7}$, which is not valid since $0 \leq r < 1$. 

For $n = 4$, we have $r = \frac{23}{7} - 2(4) = \frac{23}{7} - \frac{56}{7} = \frac{-33}{7}$, which is also not valid. 

Thus, there is no solution that satisfies the conditions given in the problem. 

\boxed{\text{No solution}}",0.0,10.85012173652649,726,298,64
