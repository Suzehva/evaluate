0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","Expert 1: To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to look for the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal zero.

Expert 2: The denominator of the fraction is $x^2+x-6 = 0$. We can factor this to $(x+3)(x-2) = 0$.

Expert 3: Setting each factor equal to zero gives us $x+3=0$ and $x-2=0$, so the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero are $x=-3$ and $x=2$.
