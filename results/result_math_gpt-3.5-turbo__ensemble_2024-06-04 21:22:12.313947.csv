0,How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?,Level 3,Algebra,"The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.","Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function is equal to zero. In this case, we need to find where $x^2+x-6=0$.

Factoring, we have $(x+3)(x-2)=0$, so the solutions are $x=-3$ and $x=2$. Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",1.0,8.720384359359741,711,121,55,"['Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function is equal to zero.
