0,"Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl} ax+3, &\text{ if }x>2, \\
x-5 &\text{ if } -2 \le x \le 2, \\
2x-b &\text{ if } x <-2.
\end{array}
\right.\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).",Level 5,Algebra,"For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must ""meet"" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\boxed{0}$.","Expert 1: I will start by finding the value of $a$. Since $f(x)$ is continuous, we know that the value of the function at $x=2$ should be equal to the value of the function at $x=2$ (from the right side).
Expert 2: So, plugging in $x=2$ into the first piece of the function, we get $2a+3$. Plugging in $x=2$ into the second piece, we get $2-5=-3$.
Expert 3: Since $f(x)$ is continuous, $2a+3=-3$. Solving for $a$ gives $a=-3$.
Expert 1: Now, we can find the value of $b$ by doing a similar process at $x=-2$. 
Expert 2: So, using the second and third pieces of the function, we get $-2-5=-7$ and $-4-b$. Setting these equal, we find $-4-b=-7$.
Expert 3: Solving for $b$ gives $b=3$.
Expert 1: Finally, $a+b=-3+3=\boxed{0}$.",1.0,4.127878189086914,451,253,198
1,"A rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",Level 5,Algebra,"Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{98}$.","Expert 1: Let's denote the number of band members as $n$. This means we have $n = mr + 2$ where $n < 100$.

Expert 2: Increasing the number of members in each row by 1 and reducing the number of rows by 2, we get $(m+1)(r-2) = n$.

Expert 3: Substituting $n = mr + 2$ into $(m+1)(r-2) = n$, we have $(m+1)(r-2) = mr + 2$.

Expert 1: Expanding that equation gives $mr + r - 2m - 2 = mr + 2$.

Expert 2: Simplifying that gives $r - 2m - 4 = 0$.

Expert 3: We also know $n < 100$, so $mr + 2 < 100$.

Expert 1: Substituting $r = 2m + 4$ into $mr + 2 < 100$, we get $(2m+4)m + 2 < 100$.

Expert 2: This simplifies to $2m^2 + 4m + 2 < 100$.

Expert 3: Solving that inequality gives $m < 7$, and since $m$ is an integer, the largest possible $m$ is $6$.

Therefore, the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{38}$.",0.0,6.927164554595947,521,316,205
2,What is the degree of the polynomial $(4 +5x^3 +100 +2\pi x^4 + \sqrt{10}x^4 +9)$?,Level 3,Algebra,"This polynomial is not written in standard form.  However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.","Expert 1: I will first identify the highest power of x in the polynomial.
Expert 2: The highest power of x is 4, so the degree of the polynomial is 4.
Expert 3: Yes, because the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial.

$\left\lceil3\left(6-\frac12\right)\right\rceil = \left\lceil3\left(\frac{11}{2}\right)\right\rceil$

4,"Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\$$660. How many days did he not work?",Level 3,Algebra,"Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \begin{align*}
x+y &= 20 \\
60x - 30y &= 660 \\
\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.","Expert 1: Let's start by defining the variables. Let $x$ be the number of days Sam worked and $y$ be the number of days he did not work.

Expert 2: Sam earns $\$60$ for each day he works, so his earnings from working will be $60x$.
 
Expert 3: For each day he does not work, $\$30$ is subtracted from his earnings, so his earnings from not working will be $-30y$.

Expert 1: We can set up an equation based on the given information: $60x - 30y = 660$.

Expert 2: We also know that Sam was hired for a total of 20 days, so $x + y = 20$.
